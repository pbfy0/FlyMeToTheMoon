		Hello, welcome to our website. Our site is about space and it's impact on us. Since its beginning, the United States’ space program has had a large impact on multiple aspects of our culture. The effects can be found in many places; dreams, museums, movies, the White House-  its impact is evident almost everywhere. Space travel plays a huge part in our  society, economy and politics. People, both in ancient times and today, have looked up at the night sky and pondered over what mysteries it may hold.  Thanks to America’s National Aeronautics and Space Administration or NASA many people’s aspirations of exploring outer space have come true. 

 After thirty years of launching shuttles into the clear skies to explore the last frontier, the  program came to a close when Atlantis, a space shuttle, touched down in Florida on July 21 of 2011. Even though NASA has ended one of its longest missions, the effects of their first mission over 40 years ago are still touching us today. Now it has newer missions such as Artemis, a project sending out two probes to study the interactions between the Earth and the Sun.

Many Americans remember when Neil  Armstrong first stepped onto the moon. Since then, NASA’s knowledge of our solar system as well as shuttle technologies have greatly expanded. This also led to an increase of jobs; more knowledge and more brains were needed.  More than 18,000 people currently work for NASA, and more and more people are hired every year. Some of the people currently employed by NASA include aerodynamic engineers, software developers, test engineers, aerothermal engineers, avionics engineers, mechanical systems engineers, structural engineers, propulsion design engineers, astronauts. The more jobs NASA provides, the more people get hired and the more America's economy grows. 

Politically, NASA has had a significant impact on us as well. We spend trillions of dollars  on building,  launching, and monitoring  NASA spacecrafts; all  the money spent  could be used for other things, like lowering our budget deficit or trying to help  other countries in need. This is one of the many reasons why on July, 21, 2011, the US government shut down NASA’s shuttle mission. Even though NASA isn’t sending people to the moon, they are still sending people to the International Space station.

In NASA’s long life, it has affected an entire generation of Americans. Our parents, who were children in 1969 and watched Apollo 11 touch down on the Moon, have grown up watching the space program develop and expand, and have always felt awed by the technological advancements made within their lifetimes. In the midst of the turmoil of 1968, the year preceding man’s landing on the Moon, the American public experienced the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. as well as the destruction and despair associated with the Vietnam War. Through all this chaos, one bright spot was the space program’s progress towards reaching the moon. Americans were allowed to live out a dream humans have held since earliest civilization, when they told of pantheons that existed beyond the stars.
The beauty of space and space travel has been wholly absorbed into American culture. One such phenomenon is the wild success of Star Trek, which blended a love of space and its creator’s knowledge of technology. Pictures sent back to Earth by satellites, such as ‘Earthrise,’ have become part of public consciousness and without the technological advancements brought by the space program, modern texters would be devastated.
In the years space travel has been available, it has stimulated the economy, created jobs never before imagined, influenced policy and changed a generation. As the shuttle program ends, so ends an era of innovation and change. The world will never be the same.
